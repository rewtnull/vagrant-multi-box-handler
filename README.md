NAME

	vmb - vagrant multi box handler

VERSION

	0.1

SYNOPSIS:

	vmb.sh [ list | up | suspend | resume | halt ]

DESCRIPTION

	Allows you to change states of multiple Vagrant boxes at once.

	I just recently started to play around with Vagrant -
	https://www.vagrantup.com - and found out that it doesn't have a built
	in way of suspending multiple boxes at once. Well, since I wanted to be
	able to do so, I wrote this little script.

ARGUMENTS

	OPTIONS

	list				Same as 'vagrant global-status'

	up				Bring all boxes that don't have the state
					'running' up

	suspend				Suspend all boxes that are not already
					suspended

	resume				Resumes all boxes that are not already
					running

	halt				Halt all boxes that are running or are
					suspended

DEPENDENCIES

	- which
	- grep
	- awk
	- vagrant

	vmb.sh has built in sanity checks and will exit if any of these
	conditions are not met.
